# API Documentation

The application uses [Scribe](https://scribe.knuckles.wtf/) to automatically generate comprehensive and interactive API documentation from your Laravel routes and controller docblocks.

## Integration Details

- **Public Endpoint**: `/docs`
- **Authenticated Access**: The API currently supports `WorkspaceApiKey` authentication.
- **Auto-generation**: Documentation is generated by introspecting controller methods, FormRequests, and Eloquent resources.

## Configuration

The configuration is located at `config/scribe.php`. Key settings include:

- `type`: Set to `static` for the default HTML output.
- `routes`: Configured to include routes with the `api` prefix or specific namespaces.

## Adding Documentation to Controllers

To document an endpoint, use standard PHP docblocks in your controller methods:

```php
/**
 * @group Workspace Management
 * 
 * Get workspace details.
 * 
 * This endpoint returns the primary metadata for the authenticated workspace.
 * 
 * @authenticated
 * @apiResource App\Http\Resources\WorkspaceResource
 * @apiResourceModel App\Models\Workspace
 */
public function show(Request $request) { ... }
```

## Generation Command

Whenever you change your API routes or docblocks, regenerate the documentation:

```bash
php artisan scribe:generate
```

## Testing

The API responses are automatically sampled during generation. Ensure your `DatabaseSeeder` provides sufficient data for realistic examples.
